A nice, recursive solution to computing all the possible permutations of a string of any length

## Dependencies
None.

### Notes 
Includes three separate test cases to demonstrate it's usage

This was apart of a problem set from MIT's course which can be found [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/). I've licensed my modifications of their software under the GPLv3 which is compatible with their creative commons license. MIT provided helper functions and some of the documentation, while I wrote the actual hangman implementation and documentation for how specific pieces of my implementation works.
